    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name's Dylan and I am currently a freshman at Cornell University, Class of 2025. I am from Queens, NY and love eating and traveling. I used to go to Bronx Science from 2017-2021. Read below to find more about me! If you have any questions, shoot me an email or connect with me on the <a href="contact.html" class="inline">contact</a> page. Here's a picture of me. (It probably won't be updated frequently) </p>

    <h2>What am I doing now?</h2>
    <p>As of 2021, I want to study computational biology and computer science. One skill I hope to learn is some data visualization. Right now, I only know some graphs and such but would like to have a formal introduction to better communicate my data analysis. </p>
    <h2>What did I used to do? (My past)</h2>
    <p>Where do I start? Maybe Bronx Science first. I guess for the non-school stuff first, I played trumpet for all four years of my time at Bronx Science. In total, I have played trumpet for 8 years as of 2021. Fun Fact: I have never taken a computer science course in high school. I don't think it has set me back at all, I just had to do some learning on the side. <br> <br> I enjoy traveling and learning about different cultures. I've been to England, Iceland, France, Norway, Spain, Italy, Mexico, the Caribbean, China, Japan, and last but not least, Canada. I hope to travel to more places after the Coronavirus pandemic. Maybe you will see a blog page soon! </p>
